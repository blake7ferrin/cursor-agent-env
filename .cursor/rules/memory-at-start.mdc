# Memory load at session start

When the conversation begins or when you have fresh context:

1. Read **MEMORY.md** to load durable facts, preferences, and decisions.
2. Read **memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md** for today (current date in ISO format).
3. Optionally read **memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md** for yesterday to capture recent context.

Use the actual calendar date for YYYY-MM-DD (e.g. 2025-02-24). If a file does not exist, treat it as empty and continue; create it when you first write to it.

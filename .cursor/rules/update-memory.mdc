# Long-term memory (MEMORY.md)

- When the user says "remember this" or explicitly asks to store something, update **MEMORY.md** with the information in a clear, durable form.
- When you infer that a fact, decision, or preference should persist across sessions (e.g. a stated preference, a decision made, a project detail), add it to **MEMORY.md** in an appropriate section.
- Keep **MEMORY.md** organized (sections, bullet points). Merge related items; avoid duplicate entries.
- If **MEMORY.md** does not exist, create it with a `# Memory` heading first.

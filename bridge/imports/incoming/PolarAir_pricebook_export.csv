All supply and return air plenums, transition fittings, and dampers.

All flexible ductwork, metal trunk lines, and duct insulation throughout the structure.

All exhaust fans and ducting (bathroom, laundry, range hood vent, etc.) that were exposed to heat, smoke, or soot.

Dispose of all removed materials in accordance with local code and environmental regulations.

2. New Equipment Installation

Furnish and install new HVAC system of equal or greater capacity than existing (per Manual J load and approved specifications).

New outdoor condenser and matching indoor coil (heat pump or A/C configuration).

New furnace or air handler, properly sized and supported.

New line set, electrical whip, disconnect, and drain system.

New thermostat (programmable digital).

Install equipment to manufacturer specifications and local mechanical/electrical codes.

Pull vacuum, pressure test, and charge system to proper refrigerant levels per manufacturer data.

3. Ductwork and Ventilation

Design and install new duct system per current code and airflow requirements.

New insulated flexible duct runs for each supply branch.

New metal trunk lines, take-offs, and balancing dampers as needed.

Proper sealing and strapping per ACCA Manual D guidelines.

New return air drop and filter rack assembly.

Replace all removed exhaust fans (bath, kitchen, laundry) with code-compliant, energy-efficient models.

4. Start-Up, Testing, and Cleanup

Test all HVAC and exhaust systems for correct voltage, amperage, airflow, and refrigerant performance.

Verify thermostat operation and temperature split.

Label circuit breakers and equipment clearly.

Clean up all work areas and remove debris from site.

5. Warranty & Compliance

All workmanship guaranteed for 1 year from completion date.

All installed equipment covered by manufacturer’s standard parts warranty (typically 10 years upon homeowner registration).

System will meet or exceed all applicable local and national mechanical codes at time of installation.

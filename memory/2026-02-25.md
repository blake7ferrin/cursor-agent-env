- **Dev environment setup (Cloud Agent):** Installed bridge deps (`npm install`), ran unit tests (4/4 pass), started bridge in dev mode on port 3000, verified `/health`, PWA UI, and auth endpoints. Fixed AGENTS.md inaccuracies (test suite exists, BRIDGE_AUTH_TOKEN is required). Set update script to `cd bridge && npm install`.
- **Hello world test:** Successfully sent chat message via `POST /chat` with real `BRIDGE_AUTH_TOKEN` and `CURSOR_API_KEY`. Bridge launched Cursor Cloud agent (`bc-6c73f640-df3e-48ea-b557-2384c52deaa5`), polled 5 min, returned "Agent still running" (expected). Agent mapping persisted via `GET /agent/:userId`. PWA UI also tested — auth validation works correctly (rejects wrong token).

# 2026-02-25

- Session: Reviewed repo architecture and bridge setup; identified priorities around bridge state persistence, orchestrator command execution path, security hardening, and basic test/observability additions.
- Session: Implemented bridge hardening: file-backed user->agent store, authenticated `/chat` and `/agent` endpoints with rate limiting, enforced explicit `user_id`, executed parsed `SUBAGENT`/`LOCAL_ACTION` commands with allowlists, and updated bridge/PWA docs for new env vars.
- Session: Added Redis-backed persistence path (`REDIS_URL`) for agent mapping and rate limiting, refactored orchestrator dispatch into a dedicated module, and added Node test coverage for parser + dispatch with passing test run.
- Session: Searched Desktop for Cursor-relevant files and created archive \\cursor-helpful-files-2026-02-25_001113.zip\\ containing Cursor.lnk plus manifest.
- Session: Built HVAC ingestion bundle \\cursor-ingestion-hvac-2026-02-25_001317.zip\\ from Downloads with AC Pro/pricebook/spec artifacts and manifest noting missing Day & Night/options-adders/quote-sheet matches.
- Session: Added shared Google Sheet export and source link into updated bundle \\cursor-ingestion-hvac-2026-02-25_001317_with-sheet.zip\\.
- Session: Copied HVAC ingestion ZIP into workspace root for immediate sharing/use.

- Session: Continued estimator agent: unpacked cursor-ingestion-hvac-2026-02-25_001317_with-sheet.zip into bridge/imports/incoming/, added import folder structure (templates, catalog), CSV importer with validation (required fields, tonnage/system-type parsing, duplicate SKUs, cost vs price), validation report and equipment-and-adders.json catalog, npm run ingest and POST /ingest endpoint. Recorded HVAC quoting assumption and import pipeline in MEMORY.md.

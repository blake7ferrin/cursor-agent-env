- **Dev environment setup (Cloud Agent):** Installed bridge deps (`npm install`), ran unit tests (4/4 pass), started bridge in dev mode on port 3000, verified `/health`, PWA UI, and auth endpoints. Fixed AGENTS.md inaccuracies (test suite exists, BRIDGE_AUTH_TOKEN is required). Set update script to `cd bridge && npm install`.

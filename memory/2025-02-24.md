Daily log template. The agent appends session notes and events here (append-only). One file per day; use YYYY-MM-DD for the filename.

- **Session:** User asked about new Cursor agent environment (secrets per env, terminal/desktop/git views, Slack). Clarified Slack = control agents from channels; Telegram/PWA = continuous chat with one agent. Updated README with "Cursor agent environment (dashboard)" and "Slack vs Telegram/PWA" sections; updated MEMORY.md with product notes and Slack vs bridge.
